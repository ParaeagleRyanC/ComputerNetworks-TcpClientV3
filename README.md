# TCP Client v3

TCP Client v3 is built with [TCP Client v1](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/ComputerNetworks-TcpClientV1/) and [TCP Client v2](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/ComputerNetworks-TcpClientV2/) as its base versions. The major difference is that a binary protocol is implemented. Meaning instead of using ASCII, binary is used.

This program demonstrates the knowledge of monitoring memory leaks using `Valgrind`, bit fields in C, and implementation of a binary protocol.
